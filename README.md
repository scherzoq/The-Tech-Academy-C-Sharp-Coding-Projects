# The Tech Academy C# Coding Project: Restaurant Review MVC Using Entity Framework
This C# coding project is one of the large-scale projects I completed for The Tech Academy's C# and .NET Framework Boot Camp. For this project, I independently researched the use of Entity Framework Code First, and then used what I learned to create a fully functional web application (MVC) for restaurant reviews.

This web application integrates C#, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. It is built upon on a relational database of restaurants, reviewers, and restaurant reviews (I have included code that populate these databases with sample seed data). The application allows for full create/edit/etc. functionality for each of the databases.
