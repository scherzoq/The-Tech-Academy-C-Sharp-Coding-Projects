# The Tech Academy C# Coding Project: Restaurant Review MVC Using Entity Framework
This C# coding project is one of the large-scale projects I completed for The Tech Academy's C# and .NET Framework Boot Camp. For this project, I independently researched the use of Entity Framework Code First, and used what I learned to create a fully functional web application (MVC) for restaurant reviews.

This web application integrates C#, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. It is built upon on a relational database of restaurants, reviewers, and restaurant reviews (I have included code that populate these databases with sample seed data). The application allows for full create/edit/etc. functionality for each of these databases.

## Summary of Skills Learned/Reinforced
* Model-view-controller (MVC)
* Entity Framework Code First. Learned about this topic independently, then applied what I'd learned to this project. This also gave me more general experience in learning about new aspects of software development independently.
* Testing/debugging. Used seed data to test every function of the site, methodically working through problems in my code.
* Researching solutions/overcoming roadblocks. For example, I was able to use reserach to find solutions to various display problems, including problems relating to enums and default date values in the Edit views.
